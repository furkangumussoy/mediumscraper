MediumScraper is a Python web scraper designed to make collecting articles from the Medium platform easier. The code is ideal for those looking to gather data from Medium articles on specific topics, for instance, if you are a researcher or a data analyst looking to study a particular subject or a marketer interested in content marketing.

To use the MediumScraper code, enter the tag for the topic you want to explore. The code then automatically starts the web driver and loads the latest articles for that tag. The scraper then extracts the article metadata and content, including the dynamic content that is usually difficult to extract using BeautifulSoup. Finally, the scraped data is saved to a CSV file, allowing you to quickly work with the data or analyze it in other applications.
The MediumScraper code is user-friendly and highly flexible, making it easy to modify the code to perform more complex scraping tasks. This scraper is an excellent tool for anyone seeking to extract data and information from Medium on specific topics.
